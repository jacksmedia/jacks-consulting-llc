This is a stub. More to come on all of these topics, especially CAKE.

[HEX](https://hex.com/) looks very cool, and is a good choice for long-term investment in the crypto world. Why? Check out their excellent site. We'll feature a more detailed explanation soon!

> HEX is an ERC-20 token, a programmable asset

Here's [the Etherscan listing for HEX](https://etherscan.io/address/0x2b591e99afe9f32eaa6214f7b7629768c40eeb39), where you'll find the contract address you'll need to copy and and paste. I'll just share it here, too, but please go verify it yourself if you feel the need.

TrustWallet will work well as a place to add this address, and then you can Exchange a currency like ETH for HEX. Hold the HEX for a long time, or stake it for compounding interest. More to come...
