🛫 Welcome to the future! 

# In December of 2021, NFTs Invaded My Life
So I took advice from movies and anime and did indeed "Go With the Flow" regarding NFT ownership. Within 40 days I have collected 20 NFTs, some exceptionally rare and 2 gifts. These exist mainly on the Elrond blockchian, versus Bitcoin or Ethereum or Cardano. Most of them pay me weekly income that can easily yield even more income when invested. Seriously.

While I write up the notes behind my amazing past 40 days, and how you can also acquire 21st-century trading cards that pay weekly yield, I'll direct your attention to this bit of guides from last year. They are still very helpful and kind of fun. I wouldn't bother with that DeFi stuff, though. Absolutely ridiculous.
